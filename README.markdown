# Today's Project: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot

Welcome to my RAG Chatbot project! üéâ This project demonstrates how to build a knowledge base-powered AI solution using Amazon Bedrock, enabling efficient information retrieval and human-like responses. Inspired by the growing role of NLP in AI applications, this project explores how to integrate advanced technologies to create a practical chatbot.

## Main Features üöÄ

- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Retrieve relevant information from a centralized knowledge base built with Amazon Bedrock and OpenSearch.
- **Document Processing**: Automatically ingest, chunk, and embed documents (e.g., financial reports) for efficient querying.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Leverage advanced models like Llama 3.3 70B to generate human-like answers based on retrieved data.
- **Customizable Retrieval**: Switch between "Retrieval Only" mode for raw data references or full AI-generated responses.
- **Scalable Storage**: Utilize Amazon S3 for storing and managing raw data seamlessly.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Languages/Frameworks**: Python
- **Services**: Amazon Bedrock, Amazon S3, OpenSearch Serverless
- **AI Models**: Titan Text Embeddings v2, Llama 3.3 70B
- **Tools**: AWS Management Console

## Installation and Execution üñ•Ô∏è

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have an AWS account with access to Bedrock and S3 services.
2. **Setup AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS CLI with appropriate permissions.
3. **Create S3 Bucket**: Upload financial reports (e.g., Oracle, PayPal, Netflix) to an S3 bucket in the same region as your Bedrock instance.
4. **Configure Knowledge Base**: Use Amazon Bedrock to create a knowledge base, linking it to your S3 bucket and setting up OpenSearch as the vector store.
5. **Enable AI Models**: Grant access to specific models (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B) via Bedrock settings.
6. **Sync and Test**: Initiate the sync process and test the chatbot with sample queries.

## Project Structure üìÇ

- **S3 Bucket**: Stores raw documents (e.g., financial reports).
- **Knowledge Base**: Manages embeddings and vector storage via OpenSearch.
- **Chatbot Interface**: Integrates Bedrock AI models for response generation.

## Next Steps and Contributions üå±

This project is a starting point to explore RAG and NLP techniques. Future enhancements could include multi-language support or integration with real-time data sources. Contributions are welcome‚Äîfeel free to fork the repository, suggest improvements, or share your own RAG implementations!
